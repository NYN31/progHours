# progHours

Competitive programmers are always on the lookout for ways to improve their skills. For a participant, sometimes it gets difficult to stay motivated at times. This is where our appcation comes into play. We've tried to gamify the whole experience of Competitive Programming. We have a few primary goals in mind. 

- Help competitive programmers in keeping track of what they are doing throughout their journey.
- Provide a competitive environment for competitive programmers to keep going without slowing down.
- Assist coaches in identifying the most dedicated competitors.
